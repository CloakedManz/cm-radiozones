# cm-radiozones
 
Welcome to CM-RadioZones! 

This resource is intended to allow radio deadzones to be added into the map in QB-Core Communities!

This is intended for out of the way areas like in low valleys, or mountain tops! 

It saves the prior radio frequency so when you leave the deadzone it auto connects you back.

It also has interact-sound integration with a connect and disconnect sound.

# How does it work?

* Grab the coordinates of a area you want a deadzone
* Enter the coordinates and set the radius and a name in the config.lua
* Start the script and tada!
       

### Planned Updates

* Hackable features to create deadzones across the map (Super fun for heists!)
